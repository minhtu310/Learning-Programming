Most Python code is either a module to be imported, or a scipt that does something.
However, sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script.
To do this, place scipt code inside if __name__ == "__main__".
This ensures that it won't be run if the file is imported.

Example:
def function():
  print("This is module function")
if __name__ = "__main__":
  print("This is a scipt")
