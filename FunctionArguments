Using *args as a function parameter enables you ti pass an arbitrary number of arguments to that function. The arguments are then accesible as the tuple args in the body of the function.
Named parameters to a function can be made optional by giving them a default value. These must come after named parameters without a default value.
**kwargs allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance. The keywords return a directory in which the keys are the argument names, and the values are the argument values.
